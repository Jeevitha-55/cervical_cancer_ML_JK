# cervical_cancer_ML_JK
This project applies Machine Learning to predict cervical cancer risk using patient records and risk factors. It includes data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall. The goal is to aid early detection and diagnosis for better healthcare outcomes.
# **Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict **cervical cancer risk** using patient records and risk factors. The goal is to aid in early detection and diagnosis for better healthcare outcomes.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Implemented **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measured **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to compare model performance.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: Cervical cancer dataset
- **Attributes**: Includes patient history, risk factors, and test results.

## **Installation & Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jeevitha-55/cervical_cancer_ML_JK.git

   
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd cervical_cancer_ML_JK

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Usage**
To run the model, open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
Then, open the cervical_cancer_ML_PROJECT.ipynb file and run the cells step by step.
